## Description

This application is for people to create polls to know the real opinion of other people about a specific subject, other people can interact and vote and if they want they can leave a comment about the subject.

## User Stories

-  **Signup:** As an anonymous user I can sign up on the platform so that I can start creating and managing tournaments.
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my profile and start creating and managing tournaments.
-  **Logout:** As a logged in user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
-  **Profile Page**: As a logged in user I can visit my profile page so that I can access the edit page and see the list of tournaments I have created.
-  **Create Polls :** As a logged in user I can access the add polls page so that I can create a new poll.
-  **Polls List:** As a logged in user I can access the polls list page so that I can access the list I created.
